# GDB_Files

The thesis is the in the StartHere repository.

This repository contains three files:

GDB_ForMapsAndLayouts.zip
  WestHawaiiWaterQualityV4N.gdb - the geodatabase I used to create the maps and layouts using the FCStation data.
  
GDB_OnlyData.zip
   WestHawaiiWaterQualityV5.gdb - just the FCStation feature classes, TBSample/TBResult tables

XLS_Files.zip
   FCStation/TBSample/TBResult.XLS for each of the projects of the thesis. These XLS files come from ArcGIS Pro geoprocessing outputs.
